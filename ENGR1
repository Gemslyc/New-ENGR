				<ul>
                	<li>Following the instructions provided I was able to install the print into the harddrive after editing it to fit my name, but I ran into multiple issues. First being and adhesion issues which I learned could be caused by the slightest touch to the surface being printed on. </li>
                	<li>The second time I attempted to print my key chain the nozzle refused to print the remaining chain, which I later learned was caused by under extrusion of the machine, another machine failure./li>
                	<li>The next time times I would fail would be human error, with the third time being the lack of material being supplied to the printer </li>
                	<li>fourth being another issue with the printers, as mine grew too close to the surface it meant to print in, scraping the surface of the platform. Initially the process was daunting, I had never printed something like this and so had my classmates but with trial and error, pressing buttons to see what they did, as well as some advice from Penny and other classmates I was able to finally understand and implement the keychain into reality. </li>
